                    For the past few years, more and more news highlights regarding children being negatively impacted by technology becomes more prevalent. While society rapidly 
                    continues to utilize technology, children at a younger age have more access than ever. We believe at Digital Balance that technology use has more negative impacts than 
                    positive on children. Join us and our mission to disable technology use in young children's homes and schools through our program.

                   Once you sign up with Digital Balance, we receive access to all of your children's devices and have the power to disable them. We also
                   have a community petition with local school systems to get rid of technology devices such as iPads, laptops, smartphones, and smartboards across all classrooms. We believe at Digital
                   Balance that technology does not propel the development of our youth.

                    Our program offers a clear cut process to fighting technology addiction in children. Once your child goes through our technology cleansing system,
                    you won't have to worry about your child being addicted to technology again. Using past techniques such as bringing children to libraries, having outdoor playtime,
                    as well as educating them on the negatives of technology has all been proven to be helpful.
